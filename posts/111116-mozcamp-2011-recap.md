<img src="Mozcamp_2011.png" class="txt" /> This weekend the [Mozcamp 2011](https://wiki.mozilla.org/EU_MozCamp_2011/) took place at Berlin. This was actually the first Mozilla event I participated and I really had a great time, meeting a lot of mozillians, exchanging ideas, talking about the future of the web we are to trying to build.

Some of the highlights of this Mozcamp:

**ReMo project**

Being a Mozilla Rep myself, I should start from this one. If you aren't already aware of what that is, go to the [relevant wiki page](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo) and dig around. The Mozcamp was a great chance to get more familiar with the [SIGs](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/SIGs) (Special Interested Groups) inside Mozilla and of course socialize with other Mozilla Reps.

**Mozspaces**

This is fairly new (I think). It's an effort of [building spaces](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/mozspaces-usage) all around the globe for Mozillians to meet and work together.

**Mozilla IT**

Wouldn't be nice if the Mozilla IT infrastructure was so open that community members could participate? Check out how you can do it on this [blog post](http://people.mozilla.org/~mrz/blog/4.html).

**Open Web Apps**

I've [written before](/2011/08/05/open-web-apps-its-not-just-the-future-its-also-cool/) about that. In Mozcamp I had the chance to see the current state of [open web apps](https://apps.mozillalabs.com/) and watch a live demo of the [apps place](https://apps.mozillalabs.com/appdir/).

**Boot to Gecko** One of the hottest Mozilla [projects](https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G) right now. Many WebAPIs have already been implemented and we actually had the chance to see a live demo of phone/sms web apps. So.. [are we mobile yet?](http://arewemobileyet.com/)

**PDF.js**

Getting HTML5 technologies to their limits. I attended the presentation, and really got impressed by the work been [made so far](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js). It's good to know that Adobe Reader it's one of the [most vulnerable programmes](https://www.csis.dk/en/csis/news/3321/) on the web.

**Developer engagement & Browser ID**

Great talks by [Christian Heilmann](http://christianheilmann.com/), on how to become an ass kick public speaker (!) and on the current state of [browserid](https://browserid.org/). I learned about a cool tracking page of [Mozilla public speeches](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/events), about the browserid [future plans](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Engagement/Developer_Engagement/BrowserIDPlan) and discovered a [detailed browserid guide](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/BrowserID/FieldGuide).

**Amo builder**

Finally a great discussion about the new Add-ons Builder (aka [Jetpack](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Jetpack)). It seems that the most difficult job there is to convience the old-school add-on developers about the neccessity of migrating to Jetpack. Some benefits: Easier coding (you don't need to know much about XUL), Restartless add-ons, Firefox version independent. [Get a ride](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/).
