<img src="fsfe.png" alt="fsfe" class="txt" /> As [officially announced today](https://fsfe.org/news/2012/news-20120303-01.en.html) I got elected on **Free Software Foundation Europe's General Assembly** as a representative of the FSFE's [Fellowship community](http://fellowship.fsfe.org/).

I hope I can help as much as I can on FSFE's causes and represent worthily the community on the General Assembly.
