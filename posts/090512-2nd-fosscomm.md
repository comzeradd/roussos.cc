Back in athens after a great weekend at larisa, where the [2nd fosscomm](http://fosscomm.gr/) (greek foss communities conference) took place. Most presentations had a great interest and workshops where the new addition of this year event. I had the chance to participate in two presentations. On saturday along with [kranidiotis](http://twitter.com/kranidiotis) we talked about the role that hellug can play inside the greek foss community and on sunday along with tampakrap we made a brief presentation of [gentoo linux project](http://www.gentoo.org/) and [gentoo greek community](http://gentoo-el.org/). Additionally, the greek gentoo community organized a workshop about gentoo installation process, with wired leading this one and the rest of us helping the participants (who were unexpected a lot).

I think the best thing in these kind of events is the fact that we have the chance to meet again all the greek free software hackers and talk (or flame :P) you can see my photo set from fosscomm on my flickr [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/comzeradd/sets/72157617998326634/).
