Inspired by [ebal's post](http://ebalaskas.gr/blog/2013/11/04/my-history-of-linux/), here is in short my linux history...

* 1997: Bought my first personal computer. Two months later I install [RedHat 5.2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux). It was the first (and last) time I bought a Linux distribution from a store. Home broadband was not there yet. It came along with a nice [book guide](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/49/Redhat_5.2_box.jpg), which I still have on my library along with the 5 CDs.

* 2002: Just before RedHat Linux was about to be discontinued, in favor of the Enterprise version and the beginning of the Fedora project, I saw this as an opportunity to try some other distro. After playing around with [LFS](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) I ended up with [Slackeware 8.1](http://www.slackware.com/). Kept it for several years, learned a lot.

* 2007: Slackare has a very limited package collection, so you inevitable end up installing things manually. So I wanted a way to do this in a more automated way. And the choice was [Gentoo Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo_Linux). Actually I [documented](/2007/09/24/the-distro-of-my-dreams/) that.

* 2010: Over the years there was a significant change on how I dealt with my everyday work. I came to a point where I started to evaluate more the UX aspect of things. I wanted a linux distribution that would just work, but would also be open as a project for contribution. So I [chose](/2010/03/12/running-fedora/) to join the [Fedora Project](http://fedoraproject.org/) and never looked back. Today, besides being an Ambassador for the project i [maintain some packages](/2011/12/08/fedora-developer/) and enjoying being part of such a great community.
