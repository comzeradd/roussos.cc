i 'm nothing like a gadget maniac, but i couldn 't resist... i 'm writting this post from my recently purchased handheld: a [sharp zaurus sl-c1000 (akita)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaurus).

![zaurus](zaurus.jpg)

it came with [qtopia](http://qpe.sourceforge.net/) installed. although its a very convinient enviroment for normal pdas, it 's kind of limited for zaurus. so very few [zaurus users](http://www.zaurususergroup.org/) keep qtopia more than a week. i kept it 2 days, before i install [gpe](http://gpe.linuxtogo.org/). i kept it another 2 days and then decided to switch to [pdaxrom](http://www.pdaxrom.org/), as i found it more customizable, and being a slackware user, that 's my major criterion.

pdaxrom is an almost full gnu/linux, that comes with [matchbox](http://matchbox-project.org/) window manager. it crossed my mind to switch it over to [fluxbox](http://fluxbox.sourceforge.net/), my regular window manager in my "normal" pc, but i think that matchbox way of manipulating desktop is more useful when it comes to small screens.

that 's all for now. i m going out, on a war driving session... :) but i 'm closing this post with the uname output:
