<img src="fedora.png" class="txt" alt="fedora" /> About a month ago I was sponsored and got accepted as a Fedora Package Maintainer. Being already a Fedora Ambassador I wanted a more technical way to contribute to the [project](https://fedoraproject.org/).

Currently I only [maintain two packages](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/user/comzeradd), but I hope I'll have the time in the near future to help more (I already digging around [Sound SIG](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Audio_Creation) 's wishlist for new packages). It's great to contribute to such a vivid community project.

Many thanks to [Christoph](http://www.christoph-wickert.de/) who sponsored me and still helps when needed.
