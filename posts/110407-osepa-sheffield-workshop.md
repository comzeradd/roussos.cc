I can't recall if I have mention the Osepa Project before. It stands for **Open-Source for European Public Administrations** and you can find out more at its [official site](http://osepa.eu/).

For the past two days I was at Sheffield University participating at the Osepa workshop, on behalf of the Central Union Municipalities & Communities of Greece (KEDKE) as their Open-Source expert. Exchanging interesting ideas with people from all around Europe.

Below are my notes, directly from my tablet. Talks and round table discussions.

And of course a group photo :)
