**Firefox OS Apps Days** are coming... A series of events which will take place in **~20 locations around the world** during the **last week of January**.

But...

...on Saturday we had a taste of what these events will be about, since we organized a small hackathon at [Athens Hackerspace](http://hackerspace.gr/). Around 40 developers showed up, willing to learn about **Mozilla's new effort to liberate the mobile ecosystem through Open Web Apps and Firefox OS** and of course **contribute to that cause**.

Some observations and remarks from the event and the feedback we got:

  * Most of the attendees already knew their way around web technologies and they realized why using them for mobile apps makes sense
  * Many people don't know that web apps are functional on Android **today** (or even [Desktop](status-hsgr.jpg)) and really get impressed when they find out.
  * Android developers got interested on using web as a platform.
  * It seems that the 5h hacking session is not enough to create a super wow app, but enough time to have some prototypes and working code.
  * Lack of thorough documentation on some [WebAPIs](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI) and on WebActivities. We really need to improve that.
  * We have to emphasize the fact that Firefox Marketplace is not just another mobile application ecosystem.
  * A 20% of people tend to register for the event and not attending. Need to remember that when setting a cap on registration.
  * The fact that we had several devices really helped during the hacking session for testing code.
  * [Firefox OS Simulator](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/11/announcing-the-prototype-firefox-os-simulator/) is awesome! It just needs support for touch events ;)
  * Maybe some mini talks during the hacking session for minor subjects would be nice (eg. [Manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/Manifest) walk through, WebActivites, more info on some specific Web APIs, intro to [responsive design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) principles, [git basics](git-basics.png)).

So hold your breath people for the big event. It's less than 2 months away. Help us liberate the mobile ecosystem using open web technologies. The only requirement for participation will be just endless love for freedom and the web. **Let's make history again in the same way we did with Firefox.**
