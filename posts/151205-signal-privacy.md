Whisper Systems failed big once again. They just [announced](https://whispersystems.org/blog/signal-desktop/) their "Desktop" version of Signal, which is actually a Chrome app.

So just to get facts straight, this is neither a Desktop nor a Web app. And just like their Android app, you need a Google account to download it.

Actually this is even worse, because you also need to use Chrome to use this app. **Channeling all your (meta)data through a closed source browser, built & distributed by the biggest tracking ad company.**

If you care about privacy, Signal is certainly not an option.
