[Fosscomm](http://serres.fosscomm.gr), the annual conference of the Greek Free Software community, took place last weekend and Mozilla had a big presence with talks and workshops the whole Sunday.

<img src="moz.png" alt="mozilla" class="txt" /> Starting early in the morning, along with [Pierros](https://reps.mozilla.org/u/pierros/), we had the opportunity to talk about "**Firefox on 2012**" and the new features that are developed and will land sometime during this year. We started with a quick summary of the things that came on 2011, as a direct result of rapid release process, and then we got through all the cool new features that are about to come. See the [Presentation](/presentations/fosscomm2012-firefox%20on%202012.html) and the [Firefox Roadmap](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/03/firefox-in-2011-firefox-plans-for-2012/).

Right after this I had the opportunity to do a hands-on presentation of all the **Firefox developer tools**, that really help the productivity of a web developer (without any need of 3rd party add-ons). In a nutshell: [Web Console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Using_the_Web_Console), [Inspector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Tools/Page_Inspector), [Scratchpad](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Tools/Scratchpad), [Style Editor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Tools/Style_Editor).

Right after it was [Fredy](https://reps.mozilla.org/u/fredy/)'s turn to give a hands-on presentation. This time about **Add-Ons** and how you can use the [SDK Builder](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/builder). Nice in depth presentation.

Then we moved to the main conference room where Pierros and Fredy gave a speech about [B2G](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/b2g/). Seems that a lot of people were aware (or at least fully aware) about this huge project. The presentation ended with a demo of **B2G** running on a smartphone, that really impressed the audience.

Back to the hands-on presentations with an **Apps & Marketplace** overview by Pierros and Fredy. It was a good opportunity to clarify why web apps are important and [what's the dereference with simple web pages](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/03/html5-the-difference-between-an-app-and-a-page/). In the end there was a joint effort to create a web app for Wikipedia, which currently is under review on [Mozilla Marketplace](https://marketplace.mozilla.org/).

[Giorgos](http://www.sealabs.net/seadog/) and me did a presentation about "**Identity on the Web**", talking mostly about BrowserID and what changes on the way we identify ourselves on the web sites we need to login or register. We did a quick demo using an [OpenPhoto](http://theopenphotoproject.org/) instance and talked a lot about the technical aspects of it. See the [presentation](/presentations/fosscomm2012-identity%20on%20the%20web.html) and especially the video on the last slide.

Last presentation by Giorgos, who did a nice motivating presentation of the **WebDev workflow** he's using on Mozilla, and which steps you have to do in order to contribute.

Then we moved to the workshop room, where we did a nearly 2h **workshop on B2G** and show in what areas any community member can contribute. I think it was a great overall  presence of Greek Mozillians, we had the chance to talk with many people, and hopefully we'll keep up on the same spirit :)
