diary post for the [greek coding camp 2009](http://greek-coding-camp.wikidot.com/) that took place at [paleochora](http://www.mapwire.net/s/35.23082734284668/23.68180274963379/09/) (chania, crete, greece) for 5 days (4-7 july 2009).

day 1 (4/7)

we reached the island at 5.30 in the morning. we made a stop to enjoy the local hospitality with a rich breakfast and an hour of sleep. we travelled by car (about 1.30h) to the camping (paleochora) and we set up our tents.

first thing to do is share the [projects](http://greek-coding-camp.wikidot.com/subject):
- OpenOffice Templates translation
- OpenOffice greek numbered lists
- OpenOffice greek build testing
- [Transifex](http://transifex.org/) work-flow support
- Letterscript for greek final "s" bug

lunch break with greek [mousaka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mousaka) and [tsikoudia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsikoudia) :D

personally i was more interested on openoffice projects and especially the [greek build testing](http://greek-coding-camp.wikidot.com/openoffice-3-1-1-testing-build).

day ended with a quick visit at the cold sea and a few glass of wine. 

day 2 (5/7)

day started with some network problems. it seems that some lady rested her bag over the router, so it got warm beyond accepted limits :P

two more new guys arrives, so during lunch break we had some great conversations.

after some installation problems we managed to install the latest release candidate on [cmpachar](http://bacharakis.com/)'s fedora laptop and on ubuntu virtualbox installation on my netbook. thanx to ntua we had access to a (12g ram, 16 core cpu) fast machine, so we also compiled openoffice straight from the subversion.

day 3 (6/7)

early waking. some of us did a nice conversation about [lost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_%28TV_series%29) and its [timeline](http://www.timelooptheory.com/the_timeline.html) :D

later we had a sort seminar-like conversation about pgp essentials and gpg usage. just to convince everyone who didn't have a key to sign ours :P 

later at night we visited the near by village and we were enlightened by [hoo2](http://houtouridis.blogspot.com/) about rubick cube solution mind algorithms.

day 4 (7/7)

day began with openoffice testing again. cmpachar did a great job there.

a new page added to the event wiki, since we managed to convience [a young user](http://greek-coding-camp.wikidot.com/littlemary) for the benefits of free software ([potato guy](http://games.kde.org/game.php?game=ktuberling) really helped on this one).

highlights: openoffice greek build testing completed for the greek build by [cmpachar](http://bacharakis.com/) and me, [glezos](http://dimitris.glezos.com/) and [alupo](http://twitter.com/andy_lupo) completed the transifex task, [elias](http://twitter.com/eliaschr) and [manolis](http://twitter.com/sonic2000gr) translated openoffice templates to greek, pantelis and [hoo2](http://houtouridis.blogspot.com/) almost finished adding usb dsl modems support at the network manager.

totally 16 hackers joined the greek coding camp. we had great fun, combining swimming at the [libyan sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Sea) and [tsikoudia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsikoudia) with coding. i hope this will be a new event series in greece, so we can terrorize every greek camping with our geek conversations and habits :D
