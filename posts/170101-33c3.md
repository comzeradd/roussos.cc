Some notes and highlights from #33c3. In particular, some talks I found worth watching. I intentionally don't mention any of the much interesting self-organized sessions and workshops I participated since these are not recorded. I'm just listing some interesting projects at the bottom. I wrote these notes quickly, so I'm certainly missing some stuff.

Pro Tip: If you use Kodi, install the [relevant add-on](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on:CCC-TV_(media.ccc.de)) to watch these in comfort.
