i have to admit that  i'm really excited lately. it's great combining my interests with my job and working on something that i love doing.

three weeks ago i started working for a non-profit corporation ([eellak.gr](http://eellak.gr)) that aims in promoting and advocating free software to greek society. it consists of the majority of greek universities and research institutes (and hopefully [hellug](http://hellug.gr) in a few months).

my job is about organizing operational tasks and supervising projects, based on my technical skills and activity inside the greek libre software community.  additionally i sysadmin corporation's infrastructures.

till now the job is very interesting and fulfilling but also very demanding. i hope i'll meet the standards :)
