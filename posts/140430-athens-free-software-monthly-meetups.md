Just about a month ago [my two years term](http://www.roussos.cc/2012/03/06/fsfe/) as FSFE community representative to the General Assembly ended.

Great experience. I very much enjoyed the whole term and I have nothing but positive to keep. I met some awesome people and got in touch far more deeply with the way that FSFE works. One thing that I struggled sometimes with was to better represent the community. I mean.. the two community members sitting on GA, besides being elected for their will to participate actively at GA's decisions, are also representatives. There were many cases when I felt that I was mostly representing myself, since there was no easy way of knowing what the community feels on a certain issue. In many countries the [fellowship groups](https://fsfe.org/about/localteams.en.html) are far more vivid (and bigger) than Greece, so I guess that participating at the local meetups gives the opportunity to discuss these things and interact with (at least the local part of) the community.

With that in mind I decided that it was about time to start regular local meetups in Athens. We may not be many FSFE <del>fellows</del> members [here](https://wiki.fsfe.org/groups/Athens), but the fellowship meetups were never meant to be only for members. **So the "Athens Free Software Monthly Meetups" were born** (first Wednesday of each month, at local [hackerspace](https://www.hackerspace.gr/)). We already had our first on April and the [second one](https://www.hackerspace.gr/wiki/Free_Software_Monthly_Meetup_0514) is coming with a "Free Your Android" theme.
