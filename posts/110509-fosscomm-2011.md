A great [fosscomm](http://patras.fosscomm.gr/) (the annual greek foss community conference) took place the weekend at Patra. The organizing committee did a fantastic job, but besides that it seems that the Greek FOSS community has raised the bar of quality holding some very interesting technical presentations.

**I think that fosscomm has transformed from a communities presentation conference to a community gathering/socializing/ideas-exchanging conference. And that's a good thing.**

I had the chance to hold or participate on five presentations/workshops. Three of them were part of the [Fedora Activity Day](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FAD_Fosscomm_2011).

- [How to make money from Open-Source](/presentations/roussos-how_to_make_money_from_opensource.pdf) (along with [Evaggelos Balaskas](https://ebalaskas.gr/blog/?page=about)) 
- Hackerspace.gr (along with other [hackerspace.gr](http://hackerspace.gr/) members)
- Surviving with Gnome 3 (along with [Pierros Papadeas](http://pierros.papadeas.gr/))
- [Greek Edu: Building your own Fedora Remix](/presentations/roussos-fedora_remixes.pdf) (along with [Christos Bacharakis](http://bacharakis.com/))
- [RPM Packaging workshop](/presentations/roussos-fedora_rpm_workshop.pdf)

And for those of you who attended fosscomm and wondering what was this strange qr code all over the conference places... just scan it ;)
