        <p><a href="http://serres.fosscomm.gr">Fosscomm</a>, the annual conference of the Greek Free Software community, took place last weekend and Mozilla had a big presence with talks and workshops the whole Sunday.</p>
<p><img src="/2012/05/17/mozilla-fosscomm/moz.png" alt="mozilla" class="txt" /> Starting early in the morning, along with <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/pierros/">Pierros</a>, we had the opportunity to talk about "<strong>Firefox on 2012</strong>" and the new features that are developed and will land sometime during this year. We started with a quick summary of the things that came on 2011, as a direct result of rapid release process, and then we got through all the cool new features that are about to come. See the <a href="/presentations/fosscomm2012-firefox%20on%202012.html">Presentation</a> and the <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/03/firefox-in-2011-firefox-plans-for-2012/">Firefox Roadmap</a>.</p>
<p>Right after this I had the opportunity to do a hands-on presentation of all the <strong>Firefox developer tools</strong>, that really help the productivity of a web developer (without any need of 3rd party add-ons). In a nutshell: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Using_the_Web_Console">Web Console</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Tools/Page_Inspector">Inspector</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Tools/Scratchpad">Scratchpad</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Tools/Style_Editor">Style Editor</a>.</p>
<p>Right after it was <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/fredy/">Fredy</a>'s turn to give a hands-on presentation. This time about <strong>Add-Ons</strong> and how you can use the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/builder">SDK Builder</a>. Nice in depth presentation.</p>
<p>Then we moved to the main conference room where Pierros and Fredy gave a speech about <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/b2g/">B2G</a>. Seems that a lot of people were aware (or at least fully aware) about this huge project. The presentation ended with a demo of <strong>B2G</strong> running on a smartphone, that really impressed the audience.</p>
<p>Back to the hands-on presentations with an <strong>Apps &amp; Marketplace</strong> overview by Pierros and Fredy. It was a good opportunity to clarify why web apps are important and <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/03/html5-the-difference-between-an-app-and-a-page/">what's the dereference with simple web pages</a>. In the end there was a joint effort to create a web app for Wikipedia, which currently is under review on <a href="https://marketplace.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Marketplace</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sealabs.net/seadog/">Giorgos</a> and me did a presentation about "<strong>Identity on the Web</strong>", talking mostly about BrowserID and what changes on the way we identify ourselves on the web sites we need to login or register. We did a quick demo using an <a href="http://theopenphotoproject.org/">OpenPhoto</a> instance and talked a lot about the technical aspects of it. See the <a href="/presentations/fosscomm2012-identity%20on%20the%20web.html">presentation</a> and especially the video on the last slide.</p>
<p>Last presentation by Giorgos, who did a nice motivating presentation of the <strong>WebDev workflow</strong> he's using on Mozilla, and which steps you have to do in order to contribute.</p>
<p>Then we moved to the workshop room, where we did a nearly 2h <strong>workshop on B2G</strong> and show in what areas any community member can contribute. I think it was a great overallÂ  presence of Greek Mozillians, we had the chance to talk with many people, and hopefully we'll keep up on the same spirit :)</p>
