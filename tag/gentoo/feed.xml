      <title>my linux history</title>
      <link href="https://www.roussos.cc/2013/11/05/my-linux-history/"/>
      <content type="html"><p>Inspired by <a href="http://ebalaskas.gr/blog/2013/11/04/my-history-of-linux/">ebal's post</a>, here is in short my linux history...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1997: Bought my first personal computer. Two months later I install <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux">RedHat 5.2</a>. It was the first (and last) time I bought a Linux distribution from a store. Home broadband was not there yet. It came along with a nice <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/49/Redhat_5.2_box.jpg">book guide</a>, which I still have on my library along with the 5 CDs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2002: Just before RedHat Linux was about to be discontinued, in favor of the Enterprise version and the beginning of the Fedora project, I saw this as an opportunity to try some other distro. After playing around with <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/">LFS</a> I ended up with <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackeware 8.1</a>. Kept it for several years, learned a lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2007: Slackare has a very limited package collection, so you inevitable end up installing things manually. So I wanted a way to do this in a more automated way. And the choice was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo_Linux">Gentoo Linux</a>. Actually I <a href="/2007/09/24/the-distro-of-my-dreams/">documented</a> that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2010: Over the years there was a significant change on how I dealt with my everyday work. I came to a point where I started to evaluate more the UX aspect of things. I wanted a linux distribution that would just work, but would also be open as a project for contribution. So I <a href="/2010/03/12/running-fedora/">chose</a> to join the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Project</a> and never looked back. Today, besides being an Ambassador for the project i <a href="/2011/12/08/fedora-developer/">maintain some packages</a> and enjoying being part of such a great community.</p>

      <title>my new laptop</title>
      <link href="https://www.roussos.cc/2007/12/01/my-new-laptop/"/>
      <content type="html"><p>i wanted a small (12'' at most) and lightweight laptop. my old one (an hp) had some issues with its monitor so i decided to use it as a desktop pc with external tft, keyboard and mouse. besides that it weights 3.70kgs!</p>
<p>i didn't want to spent much money so i searched around ebay for a nice offer. i found some vaios and a cool toshiba tablet, but after some unsuccessful bids i decided to search for a mac! so now i have a ibook g4 :) it arrived just yesterday after paying 70â‚¬ to greek customs (aggrrr).</p>
<p>processor: powerpc
ram: 768MB
hard drive: 30GB
screen size: 11.8''
wireless net: broadcom 4320</p>
<p><img alt="ibook" src="ibook1.jpg" /></p>
<p>i only saw mac os once and for 10'' since i already started installing linux. gentoo of course :) so here are the short steps:</p>
<p><img alt="ibook" src="ibook2.jpg" /></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>boot with the gentoo install cd for ppc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>re-partition the disk with mac-fdisk</p>
<p>/dev/hda1: Apple_partition_map
/dev/hda2: Apple_bootstrap
/dev/hda3: swap
/dev/hda4: root filesystem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>create the filesystems</p>
<p>mkfs.ext3 /dev/hda4
mkswap /dev/hda3
swapon /dev/hda3</p>
<p>mount /dev/hda4 /mnt/gentoo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>download and install stage3 and portage 5. set the compile options at make.conf</p>
<p>CHOST="powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu"
CFLAGS="-O2 -mcpu=7450 -mtune=G4 -maltivec -mabi=altivec \
  -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -mpowerpc-gfxopt -fomit-frame-pointer"
CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -fpermissive"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mount proc and dev and chroot</p>
<p>mount -t proc none /mnt/gentoo/proc
mount -o bind /dev /mnt/gentoo/dev
chroot /mnt/gentoo /bin/bash
env-update
source /etc/profile</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>update portage</p>
<p>emerge --sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>download and compile kernel (gentoo-sources) 9. configure fstab</p>
<p>/dev/hda4     /        ext3     noatime     0 1
/dev/hda3     none     swap     sw          0 0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>install the bootlader yaboot</p>
<p>exit
mount -o bind /dev /mnt/gentoo/dev
mount -o bind /sys /mnt/gentoo/sys
chroot /mnt/gentoo /bin/bash
/usr/sbin/env-update &amp;&amp; source /etc/profile</p>
<p>emerge yaboot
exit</p>
<p>yabootconfig --chroot /mnt/gentoo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reboot</p>
<p>exit
umount /mnt/gentoo/proc /mnt/gentoo/dev /mnt/gentoo/sys /mnt/gentoo
reboot</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>wireless worked with the bcm43xx module and soundcard with snd_powermac. i still have to fix: suspend and 3button mouse emulation, but i guess they won't take me long :)</p>

      <title>the distro of my dreams</title>
      <link href="https://www.roussos.cc/2007/09/24/the-distro-of-my-dreams/"/>
      <content type="html"><p>i am was a slackware user for the last 5-6 years and i had the feeling that time has came for a change!</p>
<p>i never was bothered by the lack of a package management system, but i always wanted an automated way of <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code> applications. I am trying to have control of what is installed to my system and so what i did was using makepkg utility to create slack packages. but that was surely not enough. i needed that to be more elegant.</p>
<p>besides that there is another thing that a slack user really deny to admit. we they can defend almost any flame attack but one: that slackware development is handed by one person. sure many people of the community help him with patches or bug report but if he is busy or <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/11/16/1846207">sick</a> then a year or more may pass until stable release comes out. additionally one brain can always make a mistake on package compilations or a wrong judgement on apps selection...</p>
<p>half of my linux mates' choice is debian, mostly because of its huge community and its package management system. i always respected debian apt-get system but i also find it a little tight and restrictive. being a slack user my first priority is freedom of movements inside my box and as i already mentioned i don't bother compiling my apps (so as to use my specific configure flags).</p>
<p>you may have already guessed it. i chose the distro that keeps the very best of slack features (freedom, custom made packages, speed) and the very best of debian features (package system with dependency check, huge community).</p>
<p>i 'm actually writing this post from my first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo_Linux">gentoo</a> installation and i have to say that i 'm already thrilled! i have built up a system meeting my needs (and my needs only) and i 'm enjoying the sense of freedom that <a href="http://gentoo-wiki.com/FAQ_USE_Flags">use flags</a> give me and the speed boost. (i never expected i 'll find a faster distro than slackware).</p>
<p>i 'll be back later with further details. for now i 'm just going to get lost in this excellent gentoo documentation project: it's own <a href="http://gentoo-wiki.com/Main_Page">wiki</a>...</p></content>
