      <title>Hacking Firefox OS Developer Phone</title>
      <link href="https://www.roussos.cc/2013/05/17/hacking-firefox-os-developer-phone/"/>
      <content type="html"><p><img src="geeksphone.png" alt="keon" class="txt" /> Probably you already know about <a href="http://www.geeksphone.com/">Geeksphone</a>'s Firefox OS Developer Phones. A couple of days ago I received mine (the Keon version) as a <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Rep</a> for testing and showcasing Firefox OS on upcoming events.</p>
<p>Keon comes with an old Firefox OS build, which means that it misses many cool features already landed on the current release branch (for instance most of the contacts import options), but also makes bug reporting difficult since you have to determine if a bug you’ve found has already been resolved before reporting it.</p>
<p>So with a little help from <a href="http://adamkalis.github.io/">(Flash)Fredy</a> here are some quick steps to get your Keon device updated :-)</p>
<p>Flash a new Firefox OS build</p>
<p>At Geeksphone forum you’ll find a <a href="http://forum.geeksphone.com/index.php?topic=4834">relevant thread</a> with unofficial recent builds and detailed guidelines on how to flash it on your device. Nothing else to add here, besides the fact that flashing a build comes with a certain amount of risk :-)</p>
<h2>Update Gaia</h2>
<p>If you are feeling less adventurous you could just update Firefox OS UI (<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Gaia">Gaia</a>). The steps are really easy. Plug your device and run:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia.git
git checkout v1-train
make reset-gaia
</code></pre>
<p>This will restart your device and when it comes back you’ll have the new Gaia.</p>
<h2>The tools you need</h2>
<p>In order for all the above steps to work you need adb, which stands for <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html">Android Debug Bridge</a> and it’s a simple command line tool that helps you communicate with a connected Androd/Linux phone device.</p>
<p>Here are the steps needed to have adb working (at least on <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>). First download the <a href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">SDK tools</a> from Android. Let’s assume that you uncompressed the archive on ~/android-sdk/.</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/android-sdk/tools
./android
</code></pre>
<p>Then you check to install the “Tools”, that would probably have a “Not Installed” status on your system. This will download and install everything you need under ~/android-sdk/platform-tools.</p>
<p><img alt="adb" src="adb.jpg" /></p>
<p>If you want to use adb from everywhere you have to add it on your system’s PATH. In this case:</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=$PATH:~/android-sdk/platform-tools
</code></pre>
<p>You can add this to your ~/.bash_profile for permanent effect.</p>
<p>One last step is to add a udev rule for the specific device. Running lsusb on a terminal gives you the vendor identifier. For Keon this is “05c6″. So you have to add the line below at /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules</p>
<pre><code>SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="05c6", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
</code></pre>
<p>and tell udev to re-read the rules:</p>
<pre><code>sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
</code></pre>
<p>If you did everything correctly then plug your Keon device and run:</p>
<pre><code>adb devices
</code></pre>
<p>You should see a line for keon.</p>
<h2>Hack</h2>
<p>If you are developing an Open Web App then you could just use Firefox OS Simulator to push it on the Keon device. See how <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/05/pushing-firefox-os-apps-to-the-geeksphone/">simple that is</a>. The only thing you’ll need for this to work is the udev rule above. You won’t need adb, since the simulator comes with it’s own copy.</p>
<p>If you want to hack around Gaia and the core apps, then just fork the code, do all the changes you want and use your repo to flash Gaia on the phone as described above.</p>
<p>Happy Hacking :-)</p>
<p><em>Important: Don’t ever choose to reset your phone to Factory defaults. It seems that currently you get stuck if you do it and the only way to undo it is by flashing a new build (I speak from experience :P).</em></p></content>

      <title>FirefoxOSAppDays - hold your breath</title>
      <link href="https://www.roussos.cc/2012/12/10/firefoxosappdays-hold-your-breath/"/>
      <content type="html"><p><strong>Firefox OS Apps Days</strong> are coming... A series of events which will take place in <strong>~20 locations around the world</strong> during the <strong>last week of January</strong>.</p>
<p>But.. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/comzeradd/8258007623/"><img alt="first things first" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8199/8258007623_4bc8fe4cbd_z.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>...on Saturday we had a taste of what these events will be about, since we organized a small hackathon at <a href="http://hackerspace.gr/">Athens Hackerspace</a>. Around 40 developers showed up, willing to learn about <strong>Mozilla's new effort to liberate the mobile ecosystem through Open Web Apps and Firefox OS</strong> and of course <strong>contribute to that cause</strong>.</p>
<p>Some observations and remarks from the event and the feedback we got: </p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the attendees already knew their way around web technologies and they realized why using them for mobile apps makes sense</li>
<li>Many people don't know that web apps are functional on Android <strong>today</strong> (or even <a href="status-hsgr.jpg">Desktop</a>) and really get impressed when they find out.</li>
<li>Android developers got interested on using web as a platform.</li>
<li>It seems that the 5h hacking session is not enough to create a super wow app, but enough time to have some prototypes and working code.</li>
<li>Lack of thorough documentation on some <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI">WebAPIs</a> and on WebActivities. We really need to improve that.</li>
<li>We have to emphasize the fact that Firefox Marketplace is not just another mobile application ecosystem.</li>
<li>A 20% of people tend to register for the event and not attending. Need to remember that when setting a cap on registration.</li>
<li>The fact that we had several devices really helped during the hacking session for testing code.</li>
<li><a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/11/announcing-the-prototype-firefox-os-simulator/">Firefox OS Simulator</a> is awesome! It just needs support for touch events ;)</li>
<li>Maybe some mini talks during the hacking session for minor subjects would be nice (eg. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/Manifest">Manifest</a> walk through, WebActivites, more info on some specific Web APIs, intro to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive design</a> principles, <a href="git-basics.png">git basics</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>So hold your breath people for the big event. It's less than 2 months away. Help us liberate the mobile ecosystem using open web technologies. The only requirement for participation will be just endless love for freedom and the web. <strong>Let's make history again in the same way we did with Firefox.</strong></p>
