<p>I always like to test distributions but due to lack of time i rarely do it :) I'm using <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> for quite some time now (and <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> on some machines I administrate), but i wanted a more desktop-oriented distribution, at least for my netbook where Gentoo compile-all philosophy was not the best way to go.</p>
<p>I have to admit that my first thought was Ubuntu. Maybe because I'm already using an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apt-get">apt-get</a> distro and it seemed like the obvious choice. But who am I kidding? I'm an active member of Greek FOSS Communtiy, so the existence, and more important the quality and activities, of the community that inevitably grows around a distribution is very important thing to me. So I was looking for a desktop-oriented distribution with bleeding-edge technologies and vivid community. And the only name that came up to my mind was <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>!</p>
<p>I first <a href="https://twitter.com/comzeradd/status/9186810365">installed it on my netbook</a>, where I also had the ability to test Moblin (on Fedora it's just a 'yum install @moblin-desktop' away :)) and I was so pleased by the performance that I have already <a href="https://twitter.com/comzeradd/status/9870283547">Fedorized my Desktop</a>! Did i said anything about the community? I was impressed by the quality of Fedora community last year on <a href="http://fosdem.org/2010/">Fosdem</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/comzeradd/status/8718398909">that impression was enhanced this year</a> by Fedora's participation on the biggest FOSS European Conference. Besides that, over the last 1-2 years i have met some members of the Greek Fedora Community, the Greek Fedora Ambassadors, and i have to admit that it's one of the most active and vivid community in Greece. Being willing to contribute, as i already do in many ways for FOSS in general with mostly advocating activities, I have already apply for <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors">Fedora Ambassador</a> and hoping to find the time to be more involved and active inside Fedora ecosystem.</p>
<p>PS. for those wondering, Gentoo (and secondly Debian) will still be my first choice when it comes to Systems Administration, but it was time i move over to a new Desktop Distribution.</p>
